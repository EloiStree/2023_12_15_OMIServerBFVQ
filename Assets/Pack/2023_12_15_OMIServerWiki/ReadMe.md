# OMI Server

Omi is based on named boolean.
- So you must be able to store and hook to boolean changed.

Joystick are based on boolean and float 
- So be able to store named float and turn them to boolean on the server must be a feature

With XR a lot's of computation are based Vector3 and Quaternion and I have the feeling of be able to push them on the server and make the translation here to boolean and float could be a good idea.
- Be able to push and get Vector3 and Quaterion
- Be able to add lua and python script to translate V3 and Q4 to float and boolean.
